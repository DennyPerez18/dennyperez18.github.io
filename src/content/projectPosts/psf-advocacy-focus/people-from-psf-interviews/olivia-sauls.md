Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to feature Olivia
Sauls, Program Director at the PSF.

Letâ€™s get to know Olivia better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

Iâ€™m originally from Chicago, IL, and I graduated from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 2020, where I double majored in Biology and Nonprofit
Management.

I have always been passionate about nonprofit and volunteer work, and I
currently volunteer with my local animal shelter, PAWS Chicago. When Iâ€™m not
working, I love exploring the outdoors, traveling, and spending quality time
with my dog, friends, and family.

### **Can you describe your role within the Python Software Foundation and the key responsibilities that come with it?**

As Program Director, my role is solely focused on planning and executing PyCon
US each year.

My responsibilities include:

- Managing the PyCon US website and Call for Proposals (CFP) launches

- Coordinating sponsorships and volunteer efforts

- Planning every detail of the conference and working with all vendors

- Sourcing cities and venues for future PyCon US events (about four years in
  advance)

Additionally, I serve as Assistant Secretary to the PSF Board, keeping PSF
public records up to date and handling multiple administrative tasks for the
foundation.

### **What motivated you to get involved with the Python Software Foundation, and how has your journey been since you joined?**

I pursued degrees in Biology and Nonprofit Management because Iâ€™ve always been
interested in the intersection of community and scienceâ€”where collaboration
drives meaningful and inclusive improvements.

I found that the PSFâ€™s mission aligned with these values, and I wanted to be a
part of it. Since joining, Iâ€™ve learned so much about the Python community and
have met wonderful and inspiring people.

My work with PyCon US has given me the opportunity to collaborate with an
incredible group of people, emphasizing the importance of diverse community
perspectives in making the event accessible and meaningful for everyone.

### **Can you share a memorable project or initiative youâ€™ve worked on at the PSF that had a significant impact on the community?**

My most memorable project was my first PyCon USâ€”PyCon US 2022 in Salt Lake City.

It was my first real immersion into the Python community, and I immediately felt
welcomed. I was overwhelmed by the support and generosity of the
attendeesâ€”whether through volunteering or simply stepping in to help wherever
needed.

That experience deepened my appreciation for the Python community and motivated
me to continue working on ways to support and enhance the experience of PyCon US
and the PSFâ€™s broader initiatives.

### **What advice would you give to individuals looking to contribute to the Python community or get involved with the PSF?**

Although there are several online channels to engage with the Python community,
I highly recommend attending local Meetups or regional PyCons to connect with
other Pythonistas.

Attending PyCon US is another fantastic way to get involved, offering numerous
volunteering and networking opportunitiesâ€”though it only happens once a year.

Through local Meetups and regional conferences, you can learn about:  
âœ… Conference and event organizing  
âœ… Mentorship opportunities  
âœ… Other meaningful ways to contribute to the community
