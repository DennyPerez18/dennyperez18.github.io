Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to feature Marie
Nordin, Community Communications Manager at the PSF.

Letâ€™s get to know Marie better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I have a background in community management in Open Source, where Iâ€™ve spent the
last five years honing my skills in communications, events, and project
management. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Visual Media (photography and graphic
design) from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

I got started in Open Source in 2013 through an Outreachy internship working on
Fedora Badges Design with the Fedora Project.

Outside of work, I enjoy drawing, painting, crafting, jigsaw puzzles, board and
video games, and doing home improvements. I live in Rochester, NY, with my
partner, three cats, a dog, and many plants!

### **Can you describe your role within the Python Software Foundation and the key responsibilities that come with it?**

As the Community Communications Manager at the PSF, I get to wear many hats! My
key responsibilities include:

- Creating and curating content for various PSF platforms

- Ensuring consistent messaging across all our channels

- Collaborating with the PSF team to meet the evolving needs of our community

I manage the production of our quarterly newsletters, Annual Impact Report, the
PSF Booth at PyCon US, and our end-of-year fundraiser. Additionally, I support
our Board elections, administer the PSF Fellows and Grants Workgroups, and
assist the Diversity & Inclusion Workgroup.

In the past year, Iâ€™ve been deeply involved in refreshing the PSF Grants
Program, introducing Office Hours, and working behind the scenes to improve the
program.

### **What motivated you to get involved with the Python Software Foundation, and how has your journey been since you joined?**

My motivation for joining the PSF team came from the alignment of its mission
with my personal valuesâ€”particularly the goal to "support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community."

Joining the PSF, a nonprofit dedicated to community development, gave me the
opportunity to work with people who share a common goal: making a difference and
amplifying diverse voices.

Since joining the PSF a year ago, Iâ€™ve gained valuable insights through my role
as administrator of the Grants Program. Seeing the global impact of PSFâ€™s
support has been incredibly rewarding, especially when grant recipients share
how the funding has benefited their local communities.

I also enjoy working closely with PSF Board members, helping translate their
vision for Pythonâ€™s future into actionable work. One of my ongoing goals is to
improve documentation for my role, ensuring better processes for years to come.

### **Can you share a memorable project or initiative youâ€™ve worked on at the PSF that had a significant impact on the community?**

Organizing the PSF Booth at PyCon US 2024 was an incredible experience!
Alongside an amazing group of volunteers ("booth fairies"), we brought our
"Desserts Across the World" theme to life.

We created fun, interactive experiences for attendees, including:

- Collaborative pixel art

- A badge flair station

- A themed photo booth

One of my favorite moments was donating items to the PyLadies auctionâ€”including
"Loren Two," an 18-foot purple snake, and the completed pixel art piece, created
by hundreds of attendees. I was incredibly proud of our team, the boothâ€™s
success, and the funds we raised for PyLadies.

### **What advice would you give to individuals looking to contribute to the Python community or get involved with the PSF?**

I would encourage individuals to know that ALL kinds of skills are needed to
build community.

âœ… It doesnâ€™t matter if you code a little, a lot, or not at allâ€”there is a place
for you in the Python community!  
âœ… Start smallâ€”lean into what youâ€™re good at, build relationships, volunteer,
and stay curious.  
âœ… Be open to learning new things! You never know where your contributions will
take you.

As someone who doesnâ€™t code, Iâ€™ve still had a meaningful impact in Open Source
communities for over ten years. Everything Iâ€™ve contributed has been welcomed
and appreciated.
