Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to feature Deb
Nicholson, Executive Director of the PSF.

Let‚Äôs get to know Deb better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I grew up in Maryland, USA, and studied art‚Äîspecifically painting and
sculpting‚Äîin Massachusetts. My career path shifted when I became interested in
advocacy work, leading me to focus on voter access, civil liberties, marriage
equality, and making Massachusetts a livable place for working people and their
families.

In 2006, I pivoted toward empowering people through computing, with a focus on
data control, personal privacy, and technical education opportunities. My
experience includes working with the Free Software Foundation, the Open
Invention Network, Software Freedom Conservancy, and the Open Source Initiative.

As a volunteer, I was a founding member of OpenHatch and SeaGL, co-organized the
Boston Python Meetup, co-founded MediaGoblin, and currently serve on the board
of the Spritely Institute.

In my free time, I still love to draw, sing, cook, and enjoy sci-fi‚ÄîI‚Äôm always
happy to talk about sci-fi or cats!

### **Can you describe your role within the Python Software Foundation and the key responsibilities that come with it?**

As Executive Director, my top priority is ensuring the PSF has the resources
needed to accomplish its goals. I focus on:  
üîπ Budget and funding strategies  
üîπ Staffing and operational efficiency‚Äîevaluating what we can automate,
outsource, or eliminate to improve impact  
üîπ Supporting the Python community‚Äîidentifying areas where the PSF can better
serve users and contributors

I also handle tasks that don‚Äôt fall under anyone else‚Äôs job, including:

- Responding to tech news and policy proposals

- Engaging with community members on new ideas and concerns

- Exploring new funding sources and partnerships

- Collaborating with other open-source organizations to share knowledge and
  support each other

### **What motivated you to get involved with the Python Software Foundation, and how has your journey been since you joined?**

I‚Äôve always loved the Python community, ever since I collaborated with the
Boston Python Meetup through OpenHatch, which introduced newcomers‚Äîespecially
women‚Äîto Python. I kept showing up, and eventually, Ned Batchelder made me a
co-organizer.

Meanwhile, I kept taking roles at open-source nonprofits until Executive
Director was the only job I hadn‚Äôt done. When the PSF Executive Director role
opened up, it felt like the perfect time to step up and do more.

In my first year, I met incredible Pythonistas from around the world and was
amazed by the welcoming nature of the Python community. The previous Executive
Director, Ewa Jodlowska, built so many fantastic initiatives and connections in
the global Python ecosystem.

Now, after 2.5 years, it has been rewarding to support newcomers, foster
community energy, and strengthen the Python ecosystem.

### **Can you share a memorable project or initiative you‚Äôve worked on at the PSF that significantly impacted the community?**

One of my most significant projects was our work on the Cyber Resilience Act.

The PSF collaborated with other open-source nonprofits to advocate for changes
to European legislation that would have negatively impacted community-driven
open-source projects like Python.

Thanks to our efforts, legislators adjusted the language in the final version of
the bill to better protect open-source communities and public repositories. This
success marks the beginning of broader recognition of the unique role
open-source communities play in technology.

### **What advice would you give to individuals looking to contribute to the Python community or get involved with the PSF?**

We have many opportunities to get involved, and you don‚Äôt need to be a core
developer to make an impact!

‚úÖ PyCon US: We need talk reviewers, speakers, and mentors to help with talk
proposals! ([<u>Submit a talk or volunteer!</u>](https://us.pycon.org/2025/))  
‚úÖ Local Python and PyLadies Meetups: Join a meetup, show up, and ask how you
can help.  
‚úÖ Contributing to Python projects: If you want to dive into the code side,
check out this
[<u>Real Python guide</u>](https://realpython.com/start-contributing-python/) to
start contributing!

### **Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?**

Python is a hugely popular programming language, used by over 8 million people
worldwide, but many don‚Äôt realize that the PSF‚Äîthe nonprofit supporting
Python‚Äîis run by just 13 staff members.

The only reason we can maintain an entire programming language, host a massive
multi-day conference, and support a global community is because of the
incredible volunteers who dedicate their time to making Python welcoming and
accessible.
