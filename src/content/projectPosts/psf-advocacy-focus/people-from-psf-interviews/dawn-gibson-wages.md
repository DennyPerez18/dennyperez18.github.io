Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, community contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to
feature Dawn Gibson Wages, a Technical Program Manager, Python Community
Advocate, and PSF Board of Directors.

Let‚Äôs get to know Dawn better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I‚Äôm an African American queer woman from the southern United States, now living
in Pennsylvania with my wife and two dogs. I hold a degree in Business
Administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I learned
to code through community involvement and workplace experience, making me both a
self-taught and community-taught engineer.

### **How did you first get involved with the Python community?**

My journey started with Django, when I attended a Django Girls workshop at
DjangoCon US 2016 in Philadelphia. At the time, I was working as a SQL analyst
and wanted to expand my technical skills. Despite facing hiring challenges in my
early years, I remained committed‚Äîvolunteering, speaking, and staying engaged in
the community until I landed my first development job in 2018. My local Python
Users Group in Philadelphia played a significant role in my journey.

### **What personal or professional projects are you currently focused on?**

I‚Äôm currently involved in multiple initiatives, including:

- WebAssembly support for CPython (mentorship)

- Python Community at Microsoft

- Djangonaut Space mentorship program

- CMDLimes Python consultancy

These projects reflect my passion for mentorship, advocacy, and making Python
more accessible to diverse communities.

### **What PSF activities are you involved in, and which working groups are you contributing to?**

Right now, I serve on the PSF Board of Directors. I‚Äôm also looking to start a
working group focused on the needs of local Python user groups, ensuring they
receive the resources and support necessary to thrive.

### **What advice would you give someone considering running for the PSF Board of Directors?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start by writing about what you want to see in your community. Even if your
ideas aren‚Äôt fully formed, putting them out there‚Äîin any language you‚Äôre
comfortable with‚Äîcan spark conversations and show others your vision.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Talk to current PSF members. Many ideas have been tried in different
ways‚Äîsome succeeded due to timing and resources, while others faced legal or
logistical challenges. Understanding how to collaborate effectively within a
nonprofit framework will help shape your approach.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Share your thoughts early and often. Open source is all about collaboration.
Instead of waiting for everything to be perfect, put your ideas out there, get
feedback, and refine them together with the community.

### **Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?**

I would love to see more African representation on the PSF Board of Directors.
Ensuring diverse voices are heard is crucial to making the Python community more
inclusive and globally connected.
