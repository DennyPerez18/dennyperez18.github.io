Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to feature Phyllis
A. Dobbs, Controller of the PSF.

Let‚Äôs get to know Phyllis better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I am a CPA in the state of Illinois with a B.S. in Accounting from Clemson
University and an M.B.A. from Duke University. After starting my career in
public accounting, I spent 14 years in educational publishing, working closely
with EdTech initiatives. In 2015, I transitioned to supporting small nonprofits,
specializing in accounting, tax, budgeting, payroll, and human resources.

Outside of work, I serve as a Library Board Trustee and Treasurer of Cook
Memorial Public Library. In my free time, I enjoy running a Great Books Book
Club, practicing yoga, reading, traveling, and spending time outdoors.

### **Can you describe your role within the Python Software Foundation and the key responsibilities that come with it?**

As Controller, I oversee the PSF‚Äôs accounting, tax, cash management, budgeting,
payroll, and human resources. I also manage the Accounting Team and handle
governance and legal matters.

Additionally, my team ensures compliance with state, federal, and other
regulatory filings. I also oversee the PSF's fiscal sponsorship program, Meetup
Pro network, and work with Laura Graves on the PyCon US Travel Grant Committee.

### **What motivated you to get involved with the Python Software Foundation, and how has your journey been since you joined?**

After many years in corporate accounting, I decided to shift my career toward
public service and began working with small nonprofits. In 2017, I was fortunate
to find a role with the PSF.

One of my first major responsibilities was managing the PyCon US Travel Grants
Program, which allows members of the Python community to attend PyCon US. It has
been fun and fulfilling to help bring Pythonistas together.

Over time, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to establish employee benefits, implement a
Finance Committee, improve compliance, and support PSF initiatives‚Äîall while
working alongside a fantastic community.

### **Can you share a memorable project or initiative you‚Äôve worked on at the PSF that had a significant impact on the community?**

Two projects stand out: 1Ô∏è‚É£ PyCon US Travel Grants ‚Äì Helping community members
attend PyCon US has been one of the most rewarding aspects of my work. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fiscal
Sponsorship Program ‚Äì Supporting local meetups, regional PyCons, and development
projects allows the PSF to empower Pythonistas around the world.

While I love the nuts and bolts of accounting, the most meaningful part of my
job is working with amazing people who are passionate about Python.

### **What advice would you give to individuals looking to contribute to the Python community or get involved with the PSF?**

üîπ Join a local Python Meetup! Events are usually free to attend, and they
provide a great opportunity to meet Pythonistas of all experience levels. üîπ
Look for volunteer opportunities. If you‚Äôre near a larger Python event,
workshop, or regional conference, reach out to the organizers‚Äîmany are looking
for volunteers to help with logistics, speaker coordination, or community
engagement.

### **Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?**
