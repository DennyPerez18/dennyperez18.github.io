Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! This series introduces the
individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, community contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to
feature Christopher Neugebauer, Vice Chair of the PSF Board of Directors and
Senior Tech Lead at Maribel Health.

Let‚Äôs get to know Chris better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I‚Äôve been a Python programmer for almost 20 years, starting in high school and
continuing through my degree at the University of Tasmania‚Äîeven though Python
wasn‚Äôt taught there. These days, I live in Petaluma, California, with my husband
Joshua and our two cats, Pico and Astra. I enjoy cooking, traveling, and
supporting fellow community organizers.

### **How did you first get involved with the Python community?**

My journey with the Python community started in 2008 as a tutor at the
University of Sydney‚Äôs National Computer Science School, a week-long intensive
camp for high school students. There, I met Anthony Baxter, who was Python‚Äôs
release manager at the time. That experience showed me how welcoming and
impactful the Python community is, leading me to get involved with Python
Australia later that year‚Äîand I‚Äôve been engaged ever since!

### **What personal or professional projects are you currently focused on?**

I currently run North Bay Python, a boutique one-track conference held in a barn
near the Petaluma River. It‚Äôs a unique event that helps me stay connected with
my local Python community.

Professionally, I work as a Senior Tech Lead at Maribel Health, where we develop
a software platform for home-based healthcare delivery. My focus is on backend
engineering (Django) and infrastructure. When I get the chance, I also
contribute to the Pants Build system, though I‚Äôve been less active in recent
months.

### **What PSF activities are you involved in, and which working groups are you contributing to?**

I serve on multiple PSF working groups and committees, including:

- Grants Work Group ‚Äì Reviewing grants for conferences and workshops worldwide

- Executive Committee & Membership Committee ‚Äì Supporting governance and
  community growth

- PyCon US Committee ‚Äì Helping shape one of the largest Python events  
  Additionally, North Bay Python is fiscally sponsored by the PSF, so my work
  there also contributes to the foundation‚Äôs mission.

### **What advice would you give someone considering running for the PSF Board of Directors?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start by serving the community in other ways. There are limited board seats,
but many opportunities to contribute through PSF working groups, PyLadies, or
local meetups. A strong record of community service helps raise your profile.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Think about what unique skills you bring to the PSF. The foundation is
constrained by staff size and funding, so we often need board members who can
maximize impact with limited resources.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Board service is slow-moving but rewarding. It requires patience and the
ability to build consensus. The big changes take time, but when they happen,
they can be incredibly satisfying. If you enjoy strategic decision-making and
guiding long-term initiatives, this role may be for you.

### **Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?**

If you‚Äôre unsure how to get started, I highly recommend joining the PSF‚Äôs Office
Hours to learn more about ongoing initiatives, working groups, and ways to get
involved. There are many opportunities to contribute beyond running for the
board!
