If you‚Äôve seen the
[latest blog post from the Python Software Foundation (PSF)](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html),
you may have read that the PSF recently **withdrew a $1.5 million grant
proposal** from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).

At first glance, that might sound confusing. Why would the PSF ‚Äî the nonprofit
organization that supports the Python programming language and community ‚Äî turn
down such a significant amount of funding?

Let‚Äôs break it down in simple terms.

## **The situation**

The PSF applied for this grant to help improve the **security of Python and the
Python Package Index (PyPI)** ‚Äî the tool millions of developers use every day to
install and share Python packages.

After months of hard work, the proposal was approved for funding. That was a big
deal ‚Äî not just because of the amount, but because it meant important progress
for the entire open-source ecosystem.

However, when the final agreement arrived, it included a condition requiring the
PSF to agree not to run any programs promoting **diversity, equity, or inclusion
(DEI)**.

In other words, accepting the grant would mean stepping away from the values
that define our community.

## **Why this matters**

Diversity and inclusion are not just nice ideas ‚Äî they‚Äôre at the core of what
makes the Python community so special.  
 From PyLadies and PyCon Charlas to Python Africa and countless local meetups,
these initiatives exist because the PSF has always believed that **everyone
should have a place in this community**, regardless of background or experience.

This belief is embedded in the PSF‚Äôs mission:

‚Äú_The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers._‚Äù

Agreeing to those terms would have meant saying we could no longer support or
promote these spaces. That‚Äôs something the PSF simply couldn‚Äôt accept.

So, the Board of Directors made the difficult but unanimous decision to withdraw
the grant.

## **What this means for all of us**

Financially, this was a big loss. The PSF is a small nonprofit with a modest
budget, and this grant would have covered important work for Python‚Äôs
security.  
 But keeping our principles intact is worth more than any grant.

Still, this decision also means that the PSF will need more help from the
community ‚Äî from individuals, organizations, and companies who use Python every
day.

It‚Äôs a reminder that open source doesn‚Äôt run on code alone. It runs on people.  
 On volunteers who organize events.  
 On contributors who write documentation.  
 And on donors who help fund the work that keeps our ecosystem safe and
accessible for everyone.

## **How can we move forward together?**

This is a challenging moment, but it‚Äôs also an opportunity for the community to
come together and show what Python is all about ‚Äî collaboration, inclusion, and
mutual support.

If you‚Äôve ever learned from a Python tutorial, attended a community event, or
benefited from a package on PyPI, you‚Äôve already experienced the impact of the
PSF‚Äôs work.

Last week, I stepped into the role of Treasurer for the PSF, and I know this
will come with challenges. But I also know that we have an amazing team and a
community ready to face them together ‚Äî to keep improving, learning, and
building a stronger foundation for everyone.

Now is a great time to give back. üíô

This situation wasn‚Äôt easy, but it showed something powerful: that the Python
community doesn‚Äôt just build software ‚Äî we build spaces where everyone belongs.
And that‚Äôs something worth standing for, together.
