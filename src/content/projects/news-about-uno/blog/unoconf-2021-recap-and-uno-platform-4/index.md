This yearâ€™s [**UnoConf**](https://unoconf.com/) reminded me why Iâ€™ve been so
excited about following Uno Platform since the beginning. Even though we
couldnâ€™t all be in the same room yet, the event brought together viewers from
over 30 countries â€” proof that Uno is resonating with developers all over the
world.

The biggest news? **Uno Platform 4.0 was officially launched during the
keynote\!** ðŸŽ‰

## **Uno Platform 4.0 Release âœ¨**

Version 4.0 is a huge milestone. It runs on top of the newly released **.NET 6**
and supports **WinAppSDK 1.0** (including **WinUI 3**). From day one, Uno
Platform aimed to be more than just a UI framework â€” it wanted to be a true
platform, and this release shows just how far that vision has come.

Here are some of the new additions we saw at the conference:

- **Uno Extensions** â†’ Productivity helpers for new projects. Includes **App
  Templates** (patterns \+ recipes with DI, logging, serialization) and **Uno
  Reactive (MVUX)** for reactive, declarative business code in XAML.

- **Uno Toolkit** â†’ Eleven new controls built for a multi-platform world.
  Highlights included the **Tab Bar** (top and bottom formats), **Navigation
  Bar**, and a surprise **Auto Layout control**. More controls are on the way,
  supporting both **Cupertino** and **Material** designs.

- **VS Code Extension** â†’ A preview that brings **C\# and XAML IntelliSense**
  into VS Code, plus **Hot Reload** for faster iteration without restarting your
  app.

- **Uno Platform for Figma** â†’ A free preview that lets designers work with
  WinUI and Material component libraries in Figma, then live-preview designs and
  export XAML directly into apps.

## **Sessions & Demos ðŸŽ¤**

UnoConf 2021 was packed with great sessions covering real-world scenarios and

We also saw case studies of Uno Platform in production with companies like
**TradeZero, Kahua, and Strix**, showing why organizations are betting on Uno
for their cross-platform needs.

## **My Takeaway ðŸ’¡**

UnoConf 2021 left me feeling both inspired and optimistic. Seeing Uno Platform
4.0 arrive with so many new features was exciting, but what stood out even more
was the global energy of the community.

Itâ€™s true â€” I miss the in-person experience of shaking hands, sharing coffee
breaks, and catching up in hallways. Hopefully, by the time we meet again, weâ€™ll
be able to enjoy those moments face-to-face. But for now, Iâ€™m grateful that
technology allows us to gather online and keep building momentum together.

## **Looking Ahead ðŸŒŸ**

Uno Platform continues to prove itâ€™s more than a framework â€” itâ€™s a platform
built for the future of cross-platform development. With the release of 4.0, a
growing toolkit, and more community contributions than ever, I canâ€™t wait to see
what 2022 will bring.

See you at the next UnoConf â€” hopefully in person this time\! ðŸ’œ
