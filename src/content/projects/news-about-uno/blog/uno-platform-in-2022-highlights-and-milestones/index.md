As the year comes to a close and many of us take time to pause during the
holiday season, I wanted to reflect on what 2022 meant for
[**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/). It‚Äôs been a year filled with
milestones, steady releases, and a growing community that continues to make open
source collaboration so rewarding.

Based on the official
[**Uno Platform 2022 in Review**](https://platform.uno/blog/uno-platform-2022-in-review/),
here‚Äôs a look back at the highlights that shaped this year.

## **A Year of Productivity and Progress üöÄ**

Uno Platform‚Äôs vision has always been to make multi-platform development as
productive as possible for .NET and Windows developers. In 2022, the team
delivered on that goal with:

- **Seven releases** ‚Äî averaging one every 7.5 weeks ‚Äî ensuring developers get
  fixes and features quickly.

- Alignment with **WinUI, .NET, and Visual Studio 2022** releases, plus
  improvements to the **VS Code plugin** for XAML developers.

- The growth of **Uno.Extensions**, offering pre-built recipes for common needs
  like navigation, localization, and reactive programming.

- A stronger **design-to-development handoff** through integration with
  **Figma**, reducing friction between designers and developers.

- The team nearly **doubled in size to 18 people**, securing long-term
  sustainability for the project.

## **Release Highlights of 2022 üõ†Ô∏è**

Uno Platform shipped significant updates throughout the year. Some standout
features included:

- **Uno Platform 4.1** ‚Üí WebAssembly Memory Profiler, Android 12 support, XAML
  Style Merging.

- **Uno Platform 4.2** ‚Üí Skia+GTK OpenGL Renderer, Visual Studio 2022 preview
  support.

- **Uno Platform 4.3** ‚Üí Documentation updates, new sample app, WinUI 3
  MarkupExtension improvements.

- **Uno Platform 4.4** ‚Üí Skottie integration, high-fidelity rendering,
  WebAssembly threading support.

- **Uno Platform 4.5** ‚Üí Uno Islands, new WinUI controls, Linux framebuffer
  scaling.

- **Uno Platform 4.6** ‚Üí Support for .NET 7, Android 13, SVG, and WebAssembly
  Bootstrap 7.0.

## **Expanding Features for Developers üåü**

- **UI Features**: New controls such as PipsPager, BreadcrumbBar, PagerControl,
  and RefreshContainer. Existing controls like TickBar were aligned with
  Microsoft‚Äôs official WinUI source for full parity.

- **Non-UI Features**: Expanded APIs to support scenarios such as gamepad input
  on all platforms, clipboard access, and ambient light detection directly
  within the browser.

- **Figma Tools**: Major progress with the **Uno Figma plugin** (support for
  overrides, color roles, auto-layout, and performance improvements). The **Uno
  Material Toolkit** also added Material Design 3 support with new font styles
  and components.

- **Uno Toolkit**: High-level controls for responsive, multi-platform apps,
  featuring SafeArea, AutoFocus, StatusBar extensions, and NavigationBar
  enhancements.

- **Uno Extensions**: Improvements in navigation, authentication, splash
  screens, and performance ‚Äî all designed to reduce boilerplate and speed up
  development.

## **Learning Resources and Articles üìö**

The Uno Platform blog in 2022 featured content for both beginners and
experienced developers. Top articles included:

In addition, documentation was expanded to include more working samples, ranging
from authentication and SQLite to SignalR and custom cameras.

## **Community Growth üåç**

2022 was also a year of community milestones:

- Over **2 million NuGet downloads**.

- **7,300+ GitHub stars** and **37 new contributors**, bringing the total to
  **239**.

- Growth on social platforms:
  [**12k Twitter followers**](https://x.com/UnoPlatform) and
  [**1k+ Discord members**](https://discord.gg/3xyRtHAmXb).

- New learning resources, including Skye Hoefling‚Äôs book _Getting Started with
  WinUI 3 and Uno Platform_.

Uno Platform‚Äôs team also contributed back to other projects like .NET and
SkiaSharp, further strengthening the open source ecosystem.

## **Looking Ahead to 2023 ‚ú®**

The review closed with optimism: more resources, deeper integrations, expanded
documentation, and a growing community of contributors. Uno Platform has firmly
established itself as a leading choice for multi-platform .NET development, and
the momentum going into 2023 looks strong.

## **Final Thoughts üéÑüí°**

Writing this post over the Christmas holiday gave me the chance to reflect not
only on Uno Platform‚Äôs achievements but also on the spirit of open source
collaboration. 2022 demonstrated that productivity, innovation, and community
can coexist ‚Äî and Uno Platform continues to prove that every contribution, big
or small, makes a meaningful impact.

Here‚Äôs to carrying that same energy into 2023\. üöÄ
