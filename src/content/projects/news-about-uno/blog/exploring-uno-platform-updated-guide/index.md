One of the things I appreciate most about the
[**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) team is their commitment to learning.
They donâ€™t just ship releases and new features â€” they also make sure developers,
whether new or experienced, have resources to grow.

Last week, the team published a new blog,
[**Uno Platform Learning Resources â€“ 2023 Update**](https://platform.uno/blog/uno-platform-learning-resources-2023-update/),
and I couldnâ€™t let it pass without sharing it here. If youâ€™re curious about Uno
Platform or looking for a structured way to deepen your knowledge, this update
is a goldmine.

## **Whatâ€™s Inside the Learning Resources Update?**

The blog organizes resources into **free** and **paid** learning paths, plus
workshops and tutorials created by both the core team and community
contributors. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what youâ€™ll find:

- **Workshops & Starters** â†’ From simple calculator apps to a YouTube player
  clone, these are hands-on ways to dive right in.

- **Free Materials** â†’
  - [**_Uno Platform Succinctly_**](https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks/uno-platform-succinctly)

  - And more practical guides to building with C\#, XAML, and WinUI 3\.

The update also touches on **Uno Platform for Figma**, showing how to go from
design to generated code with sample projects like Goodreads and even a pet
adoption app.

## **Why This Matters**

I love seeing how much the **Uno Platform ecosystem has grown**. Itâ€™s not just
about building apps â€” itâ€™s about building knowledge and lowering the barriers to
entry for new contributors. The mix of official docs, community-driven
tutorials, and creative Figma-to-code guides really shows how open source
thrives when learning is a shared priority.
