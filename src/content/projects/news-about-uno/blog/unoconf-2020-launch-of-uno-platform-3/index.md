On **August 12, 2020**, the [**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) community
came together for our second annual **UnoConf** — and this year, it was
completely virtual and free for anyone to attend. Even though we weren’t able to
meet in person, the energy, innovation, and sense of community were just as
strong as ever.

Guiding us through the day was
[**Jen Looper**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenlooper/), who did a fantastic
job hosting and keeping the event flowing.

## **The Keynote: Uno Platform 3.0 🎉**

The conference kicked off with a keynote from
[**Jerome Laban**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeromelaban/) **(CTO)** and
[**François Tanguay**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoistanguay/) **(CEO)**,
who announced one of the most exciting milestones so far: **Uno Platform 3.0**.

This release marks a huge step forward for the vision of making **WinUI run
everywhere**. Here are some of the highlights announced during the keynote:

- 🐧 **Linux support (preview):** Uno now covers all major platforms — Windows,
  macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly.

- 🪟 **WinUI 3.0 Preview 2 support**, continuing Uno’s commitment to stay in
  lock-step with WinUI.

- 🎨 **Fluent and Material Design Systems:** New Uno apps come preconfigured
  with Fluent UI, and you can easily switch to Material — with Dark/Light themes
  built in.

- 📚 **Uno Gallery:** A new collection of ready-to-use Fluent and Material code
  snippets, helping developers build faster and preview controls across
  platforms.

- 🖥 **JetBrains Rider support**, expanding IDE options alongside Visual Studio
  and Visual Studio Code.

- 🖼 **Fluent UI Assets**, more macOS improvements, and performance upgrades.

- 🖱 **Windows 7 support via Skia**, adding another option to run Uno apps on
  legacy systems.

- 🎓 Recognition of the **first community-led Udemy course** on Uno Platform.

The keynote made it clear: Uno Platform is growing faster than ever, supported
by both the engineering team and a passionate community.

## **My Takeaway 💡**

UnoConf 2020 may have been virtual, but it didn’t feel distant. The combination
of technical sessions, community contributions, and the exciting **Uno Platform
3.0 release** made it one of my favorite events of the year.

This year’s UnoConf was different from the first one in 2019\. Instead of
gathering in person, we met online, each of us tuning in from our homes and
offices around the world. While I really enjoyed the virtual format and the fact
that more people could join regardless of their location, I do miss the hallway
conversations, coffee breaks, and the personal connections that only in-person
events can provide.

I truly hope that by the time the next UnoConf arrives, we’ll be able to see
each other again face to face. Until then, I’m grateful for technology and the
chance to keep building community together — even if it’s through a screen.

From my perspective as a **Software QA Analyst**, what stands out most is how
far Uno Platform has come since I first started testing it in 2018\. Seeing it
now run on Linux, embrace Fluent and Material design systems, and expand its
tooling shows just how powerful this project has become.

UnoConf 2020 showed that the future of cross-platform development with **C\# and
XAML** is brighter than ever. I can’t wait to see what we’ll be celebrating at
next year’s conference.
