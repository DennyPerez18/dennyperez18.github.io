One of the things I enjoy most about following
[**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) is seeing how the community around it
continues to grow. Today, I’m happy to share something that makes learning Uno
Platform even more accessible: a brand-new **Udemy course** created by community
champion
[**Christian Findlay**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-findlay/).

## **A New Way to Learn Uno Platform 🚀**

The course is called **“Introduction to Uno Platform”**, and it’s designed to
give newcomers a clear, guided way to start building apps with Uno Platform.

If you’ve already gone through the official Getting Started guide, this course
is the perfect next step. It focuses on building **single-source apps with C\#
and XAML** that run on:

- **WebAssembly**
- **Mobile (iOS and Android)**
- **Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)**

The curriculum guides you through a simple UI scenario and demonstrates how the
same app can run across all these platforms without requiring code rewriting.

## **Why This Is Valuable ✨**

As a **Software QA Analyst**, I know how challenging it can be for beginners to
find the right entry point into a new technology. Uno Platform is powerful, but
for someone starting out, having a **structured course** makes the learning
curve less overwhelming.

What I like about this course is that it’s not just about coding — it’s about
understanding the philosophy of Uno Platform: **write once, run everywhere**.
For anyone curious about cross-platform development with C\# and XAML, this is a
fantastic resource.

## **Course Details 📝**

- **Instructor:** Christian Findlay (Uno Platform community champion)
- **Platform:** Udemy

## **My Takeaway 💡**

I think this is an exciting step forward for Uno Platform. Seeing community
members like Christian take the initiative to create learning resources shows
how strong and supportive the ecosystem is becoming.

For me, this is also a reminder of how important education is in open source.
The more people have accessible ways to learn, the more diverse and creative the
contributions will be.

## **Call to Action 📌**

If you’ve been curious about Uno Platform but weren’t sure where to start, this
Udemy course might be just what you need. Add it to your wishlist today, and be

I’m looking forward to seeing more developers discover Uno Platform through this
new learning path\!
