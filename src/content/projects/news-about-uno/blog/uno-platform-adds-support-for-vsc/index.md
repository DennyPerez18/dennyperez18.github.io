One of the things I admire about [**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) is
how quickly it continues to evolve. I‚Äôve been following its journey since 2018,
and every new milestone feels like proof that this project is growing in the
right direction.

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share another step forward: **Uno Platform now supports
Visual Studio Code\!**

Until now, most Uno Platform development has happened in **Visual Studio on
Windows**. With this update, developers can now build and debug **WebAssembly
applications using Visual Studio Code, regardless of** whether they‚Äôre on
Windows, Linux, or macOS.

For me, as someone who works on the **testing side of the Uno Platform, this is
a significant** change. It lowers the barriers for people who want to try Uno
Platform and makes the experience of contributing more accessible to the global
open-source community.

## **About Uno Platform üåç**

For those who may be new to it, **Uno Platform** is an open-source project that
allows you to create **single-source C\# and XAML apps** that run everywhere:

- iOS and Android
- Windows
- Web (via WebAssembly)
- macOS and Linux

In other words, it brings the **'write once, run everywhere'** idea to reality
using technologies that many developers are already familiar with. Uno Platform
has been open source since 2018 under the Apache 2.0 license, and you can find
it on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno).

## **What‚Äôs New in April 2020 üöÄ**

The big news is that **Uno Platform apps can now be created and debugged in
Visual Studio Code**. This means:

- You can use Uno Platform without needing the full Visual Studio IDE.

- Developers on **Linux and macOS** can now work with Uno directly.

- Debugging **WebAssembly projects** in the browser is possible right inside VS
  Code.

It‚Äôs important to note that, at this stage, VS Code support focuses on
**WebAssembly projects only**. However, this is already a significant
development because it makes Uno Platform much more inclusive and accessible.

## **Why This Matters ‚ú®**

From a developer and community perspective, this change is significant:

- **Cross-platform accessibility** ‚Üí You‚Äôre no longer tied to Windows.

- **Lightweight setup** ‚Üí VS Code is fast, easy to install, and already widely
  used.

- **More contributors** ‚Üí By making Uno Platform easier to set up, more people
  can test, experiment, and contribute to the project.

For me personally, it also means I can better follow along with the testing
process across different environments. As a QA Analyst, I often look at the user
journey and the flexibility of tools ‚Äî and this is exactly the kind of step that
makes testing smoother and contributions easier.

## **A Quick Look at the Setup üõ†Ô∏è**

The Uno Platform team shared a simple way to get started with VS Code:

1. **Install Uno Platform templates** with a dotnet command.

2. **Create a new WebAssembly-only project**.

3. Open the project in **Visual Studio Code**.

4. Install the required extensions for C\# and JavaScript debugging.

5. Run the project and place breakpoints to debug C\# directly in the browser.

Even the basic ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù demo shows how quickly you can get an Uno Platform
app up and running in VS Code. Click a button, see the text update, and confirm
that Uno Platform is working correctly right inside the browser.

## **My Personal Takeaway üí°**

As someone who started with Uno Platform back in 2018, mostly from the **testing
side**, it‚Äôs been amazing to watch this project grow. First, it impressed me
with the way it runs across Android, iOS, and Windows from one codebase. Now,
seeing Uno Platform move into **Visual Studio Code** makes me realize how
serious the project is about reaching developers everywhere.

I might not be a programmer writing these apps, but I see the impact in testing:
it‚Äôs faster, more flexible, and much easier for new contributors to jump in. And
that, in the end, is what makes a project thrive ‚Äî lowering the barriers so more
people can join.

## **Call to Action üìå**

If you‚Äôd like to try it yourself, you can find the full announcement and setup
guide here:

And of course, all the source code is open on GitHub:  
 üëâ [Uno Platform GitHub Repository](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno)

I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing what the community builds now that **Visual Studio
Code support** is part of Uno Platform. This is just the beginning of another
exciting chapter.
