October is here, and that means it’s time again for **Hacktoberfest** — one of
the biggest open-source celebrations of the year. I’m happy to share that
[**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) **is returning to Hacktoberfest in
2020**, giving contributors around the world another chance to learn,
collaborate, and earn some fun rewards along the way.

## **What’s New This Year 🚀**

Just like last year, anyone who contributes a **meaningful pull request** to Uno
Platform on GitHub between **October 1 and October 31, 2020,** will be eligible
for prizes. This time, the rewards include:

- 🎓 **Free access** to the Udemy course _Introduction to Uno Platform_.

- 👕 Entry into a draw to win one of **30 Uno Platform t-shirts**.

## **How to Participate 📌**

Getting involved is easy:

1. ⭐ Show support by “starring” the
   [Uno Platform repository](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno) on GitHub.

2. 📝 Register for **Hacktoberfest 2020** so your contributions count toward the
   global challenge.

3. 📬 Share your contact details with the Uno Platform team so they know where
   to send your swag.

4. 🔍 Pick an issue labeled **hacktoberfest**, **help wanted**, or **good first
   issue** — these have been curated to help contributors, especially
   first-timers.

5. 🔧 Make a meaningful pull request: this can be code, documentation, samples,
   or even fixing several typos. Every bit of effort helps the project grow.

Uno Platform has also updated its repositories to align with Hacktoberfest’s new
quality guidelines, ensuring contributions focus on real value rather than spam.

## **Community Events 🌍**

This year, Hacktoberfest comes with even more opportunities to connect. Uno
community member [**Martin Zikmund**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mzikmund/) is
hosting live coding sessions on Twitch, starting with:

📅 **October 3rd, 2020 – 10:00 AM EST**  
 🎥 _“The First PR: Hacking with Martin Zikmund and Jeremy Sinclair”_  
 👉 [Watch on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/martinzikmund)

In this session, Martin and
[**Jeremy Sinclair**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-sinclair-39b6256/) will
tackle an open issue in the Uno repo, live-code their way through it, and answer
questions from the audience. It’s the perfect session if you’re just starting
out and want to see what making a first contribution looks like.

## **My Role This Year 💡**

This [**Hacktoberfest**](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is also a special one for
me. I’ll be participating in a community event where I’ll have the opportunity
to **talk about my role in testing Uno Platform**.

As a **Software QA Analyst**, my work isn’t focused on writing tests, but on
making sure that everything runs smoothly across platforms. It’s rewarding to
share this perspective with the community because open source needs more than
just code — it needs testers, documentation writers, and people who care about
quality.

## **Why Hacktoberfest Matters ✨**

Hacktoberfest is not just about winning swag. It’s about creating an environment
where developers, testers, and community members from all over the world can
contribute to something bigger than themselves.

For Uno Platform, this is a chance to welcome new contributors, strengthen the
ecosystem, and keep pushing forward the mission of making **WinUI and Windows
APIs run everywhere**.

## **Call to Action 📌**

If you’ve been curious about contributing to Uno Platform, **October is the
perfect time to start**. Visit the repo, explore the open issues, and don’t be
afraid to ask for help — the community is here to support you.

Let’s make 2020 another amazing year for open source together. 💜
