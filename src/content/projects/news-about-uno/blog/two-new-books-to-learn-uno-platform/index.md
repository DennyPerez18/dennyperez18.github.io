The [**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) community keeps growing ‚Äî and with
it, the resources available to help developers learn. Today, I‚Äôm excited to
share that we now have not one, but **two new books** that cover Uno Platform in
depth. Whether you prefer a free e-book or a full-length print guide, there‚Äôs
now something for everyone.

## **üìñ _Creating Cross-platform C\# Applications with Uno_ ‚Äì Packt Publishing**

Two of our community contributors and Microsoft MVPs,
[**Marcel Wagner**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-wagner/) and
[**Matt Lacey**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrlacey/), have teamed up to write
the newest Packt book on Uno Platform:

**Creating Cross-platform C\# Applications with Uno: Build apps with C\# and
XAML that run on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly**

üëâ Available now on [**Amazon**](https://a.co/d/7b6t0ER)

What makes this book special is its format. Instead of walking you through one
big application chapter by chapter, each section stands on its own. That means
you can jump straight to the topics you‚Äôre most interested in, or follow along
cover to cover at your own pace.

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll learn:

- How to run apps on all major platforms ‚Äî desktop, mobile, and web.

- How to use familiar tools and APIs to stay productive while targeting new
  platforms.

- How to Create Both Business and Consumer Applications with Uno Platform.

- How to set up your development environment and build your first Uno app.

- How to combine technologies and controls to speed up development.

- How to create ‚Äúworld-ready‚Äù apps that go beyond the basics.

If you already know some **C\# and XAML**, you‚Äôll be right at home. Experience
with WPF, UWP, or WinUI will help, but it isn‚Äôt required.

A big thank you to Marcel and Matt for investing the time and effort to create
such a resource for the community\!

## **üìò _Uno Platform Succinctly_ ‚Äì Free eBook from Syncfusion**

Partners at **Syncfusion** ‚Äî known for their UI components for Microsoft
developers ‚Äî have released a free eBook as part of their **Succinctly** series:

**Uno Platform Succinctly**, written by **Ed Freitas**.

This book is concise, practical, and free to download in PDF format. In just
four short chapters, you‚Äôll learn how to:

1. Set up your first Uno Platform project in Visual Studio.

2. Understand solution structure.

3. Work with XAML fundamentals.

4. Reconstruct an app into a fully functioning single-page application.

Syncfusion has published over 170+ eBooks in this series, and this one is a
great addition. Even better, the sample code is available on GitHub, and
Syncfusion has also created a **Chart library for Uno Platform applications** ‚Äî
another resource worth trying out.

## **Why This Matters üí°**

Learning resources are key to growing any open-source project. With these two
books, developers now have new, practical ways to explore Uno Platform ‚Äî whether
through a detailed, chapter-based guide or a quick, free introduction.

For me, this is another reminder of how strong the community behind Uno Platform
has become. From contributors writing books to partners building libraries, it‚Äôs
exciting to see so many people investing in the future of cross-platform
development with C\# and XAML.
