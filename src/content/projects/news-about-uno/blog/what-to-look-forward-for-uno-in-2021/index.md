As we step into 2021, I can’t help but think about how much
[**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) has grown over the past few years.
From its early days of experimental builds to now being a strong, open-source
project embraced by developers worldwide, the journey has been incredible to
witness.

Instead of looking back, I want to focus on what makes this year exciting for
Uno Platform. Based on the
[**roadmap shared by the team**](https://platform.uno/blog/top-10-uno-platform-developments-to-look-forward-to-in-2021/)
and conversations within the community, here are the things we can all look
forward to in 2021\.

## **1\. UnoConf 2021 🎤**

[**UnoConf**](https://unoconf.com/) will return this August — whether in person
in Montreal or virtually. After last year’s online edition, I’m hopeful that
we’ll get the chance to meet in person again. Either way, UnoConf is always a
highlight for sharing progress, connecting with the community, and celebrating
new features.

## **2\. Day-0 Support for WinUI 🪟**

WinUI is expected to be released in the first half of 2021, and Uno Platform is
committed to having support ready from day one. This means developers will be
able to extend WinUI experiences across desktop, web, and mobile without
waiting.

## **3\. WebAssembly Improvements 🌐**

WebAssembly is where so much innovation is happening. Uno Platform has made it
clear that performance and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation will be top
priorities this year, continuing the work from last year’s
[**3.2 release**](https://platform.uno/blog/uno-platform-3-2-net-5-c-9-support-and-net-5-webassembly-aot-support/).

## **4\. Better Documentation & Migration Paths 📚**

No documentation is ever perfect, and the Uno team knows it. In 2021, expect
more dedicated Uno-specific guides, clearer directions on when to use Microsoft
vs. Uno docs, and community-driven contributions to fill gaps. Migration paths —
especially for those modernizing desktop apps — will also get more attention,
which I know many developers will appreciate.

## **5\. More Controls & Mappings 🎨**

As WinUI matures, Uno Platform will bring more controls and mappings to match.
That includes support for third-party components, such as Infragistics and
Syncfusion, opening the door to richer, more enterprise-ready apps.

## **6\. Tooling to Boost Productivity 🛠️**

While details are still under wraps, the Uno team is experimenting with ways to
make development smoother and faster. I’m curious to see what productivity
accelerators come out of this in 2021\.

## **7\. Frequent Releases 🚀**

Uno has been speeding up its release cadence: 4 in 2019, 8 in 2020\. This year,
the goal is 8–10 production-ready releases, meaning we’ll all see improvements
land even faster.

## **8\. Uno at Local User Groups 🌍**

One of the things I love most about Uno is its community. In 2021, the team
wants to dedicate time to visiting local user groups — whether virtually or in
person. These smaller, more intimate gatherings are a great way to connect
directly with developers.

## **9\. Preparing for .NET 6 🔮**

.NET 6 is set to arrive later this year, and Uno Platform will be ready to
embrace the performance and productivity improvements it brings, just like it
did with .NET 5\.

## **10\. Fun Experiments 🚗**

From the XAML Cybertruck to the Windows Calculator running on every device
imaginable, Uno Platform has never shied away from pushing boundaries. I’m glad
to see the tradition of creative experiments will continue in 2021 — it’s part
of what makes this community so fun.

## **My Personal Outlook 💡**

Looking ahead, I think 2021 will be a year where Uno Platform becomes even more
visible and accessible to developers everywhere. With new documentation, faster
releases, and an even stronger community, this is the perfect moment to explore
what Uno Platform can do.

## **Call to Action 📌**

If you haven’t tried Uno Platform yet, now is the perfect time. You can start
with a simple app in just a few minutes using the
[**Getting Started guide**](https://platform.uno/).

Here’s to an exciting year of growth, innovation, and collaboration for Uno
Platform in 2021\. 🎉
