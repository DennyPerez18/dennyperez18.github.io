It‚Äôs been a while since I last wrote on this blog ‚Äî and what a perfect moment to
return\! üíô  
Today, I‚Äôm excited to share some truly remarkable news that highlights the
strength of collaboration, open source, and innovation within the .NET
ecosystem.

Uno Platform has officially announced a **new technology collaboration with
Microsoft‚Äôs .NET team** ‚Äî a partnership that feels both natural and deeply
significant for those of us who have followed Uno‚Äôs journey from the very
beginning.

I‚Äôve been watching Uno Platform evolve for years, ever since it emerged as a
bold open-source project determined to bring .NET everywhere ‚Äî desktop, mobile,
web, and even embedded. Seeing this next step, where Uno is now actively
contributing back to .NET itself, feels like a milestone moment for the entire
developer community.

## **Why This Collaboration Matters**

For years, Uno Platform has quietly been one of the strongest open-source
examples of what .NET can achieve. It bridges desktop, mobile, web, and embedded
development into a single codebase, giving developers the freedom to reach every
platform with one consistent stack.

But this new collaboration with Microsoft goes deeper than framework alignment ‚Äî
it‚Äôs about **joint stewardship** of .NET‚Äôs evolution.

The first tangible result of this partnership arrives with
[**.NET 10 RC2**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-10-rc-2/), where
the Uno Platform team worked closely with Microsoft‚Äôs .NET MAUI engineers to
align **.NET for Android** with Google‚Äôs latest **Android 16 (API-36.1)**
release.

That alignment may sound simple, but under the hood, it required major work:
updating tooling, refining bindings, and ensuring compatibility across SDK
versions ‚Äî the kind of deep, careful engineering that keeps developer
experiences smooth as technology moves forward.

## **Looking Ahead: Performance, Web, and Graphics**

This is only the beginning of the collaboration. Uno and Microsoft are already
working on several new fronts that could have a huge impact for developers
across the .NET landscape:

- **WASM multithreading** ‚Äì unlocking faster, more responsive .NET applications
  in the browser.

- **Improvements to .NET for iOS and Android** ‚Äì helping accelerate
  contributions and quality updates across key runtime repos.

- **Co-maintaining SkiaSharp** ‚Äì the graphics engine that powers rendering
  across Uno‚Äôs supported platforms, ensuring performance and visual consistency
  everywhere.

Each of these areas reflects something I personally admire about Uno Platform‚Äôs
approach: their contributions don‚Äôt just serve their product ‚Äî they strengthen
the foundation for everyone using NET.

## **From My Perspective**

As someone who‚Äôs been part of open-source communities for years ‚Äî and who once
had the opportunity to work as a QA Tester for Uno Platform ‚Äî this news hits
close to home.

I‚Äôve seen firsthand how much dedication goes into making cross-platform
development _actually_ seamless. It‚Äôs not easy work; it‚Äôs a constant cycle of
testing, refinement, and collaboration. That‚Äôs why this new chapter with
Microsoft feels so meaningful ‚Äî it shows what happens when open-source builders
and product teams work side by side to shape the tools we all rely on.

Fran√ßois Tanguay, Uno Platform‚Äôs CEO, summed it up perfectly:

"_.NET has been the backbone of Uno Platform from the start, and this
partnership is about giving back in a meaningful way. By investing our
engineering resources into the places where developers need them most, we‚Äôre
helping ensure that .NET continues to be the best foundation for cross-platform
development \- today and for years to come._‚Äù

That philosophy ‚Äî building _with_ the community instead of just _for_ it ‚Äî is
exactly what keeps the .NET ecosystem vibrant and sustainable.

## **A Quick Look at Uno Platform**

For anyone discovering Uno Platform for the first time, here‚Äôs a quick snapshot.
It‚Äôs an open-source framework (under the Apache 2.0 license) that lets
developers build applications for **desktop, mobile, web, and embedded systems
from a single codebase.**

Beyond the framework, the team has built
[**Uno Platform Studio**](https://platform.uno/studio/), a suite of professional
tools designed to make cross-platform development faster and more creative ‚Äî
including features like Hot Reload, Hot Design, and design-to-code integrations
across any IDE or operating system.

It‚Äôs the kind of toolset that shows how modern .NET development can be
productive and inspiring at the same time.

## **Closing Thoughts**

This announcement reminded me why I love writing about technology: because
behind every framework or update, there‚Äôs a story about people ‚Äî engineers,
contributors, and communities ‚Äî coming together to make something better for all
of us.

Uno Platform‚Äôs partnership with Microsoft isn‚Äôt just another collaboration. It‚Äôs
proof that open-source contributions, when nurtured and recognized, can directly
shape the direction of global technology.

As someone who believes in building bridges between technology and community, I
can‚Äôt wait to see where this partnership leads next ‚Äî and what new doors it will
open for developers around the world.
