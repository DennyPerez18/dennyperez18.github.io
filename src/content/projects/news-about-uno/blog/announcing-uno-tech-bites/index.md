Iâ€™m excited to share that [**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) has launched
a brand-new video series called **Uno Tech Bites** ðŸŽ¥ â€” short, practical
tutorials designed to help you sharpen your Uno Platform skills without sitting
through long sessions.

Each video is a bite-sized lesson packed with actionable tips you can use right
away in your projects. Whether youâ€™re just getting started with Uno or looking
for ways to go deeper, these videos are designed to fit into your schedule â€”
perfect for a quick watch on a coffee break or while commuting.

## **Why Itâ€™s Worth Watching**

What I like most about **Uno Tech Bites** is the format. Each video is compact
but rich in detail, showing not just _what_ to do but _why_ it matters. You
donâ€™t need to set aside hours to learn â€” you can grab insights in a few minutes
and apply them to your own work the same day.

Itâ€™s also refreshing to see the mix of **introductory content** and **advanced
topics**, which makes it easier for developers at different levels to jump in.

## **Join the Conversation**

This series is just the beginning. The Uno team is open to feedback and new
topic ideas, so if thereâ€™s something youâ€™d love to learn, you can share your
suggestions on [**Twitter**](https://x.com/UnoPlatform) or in the
[**Uno Discord community**](https://discord.com/invite/XjsmQHdKfq).

Learning is always better when itâ€™s shared â€” and Uno Tech Bites is a great
example of how small, focused lessons can make a big difference.

So, go ahead and check out the videos.
