Open source has always been built on passion. For many maintainers, their
projects are more than just code ‚Äî they‚Äôre long-term commitments, often
developed during evenings, weekends, or stolen hours between other
responsibilities. But passion doesn‚Äôt always pay the bills. And in recent years,
we‚Äôve heard more and more maintainers across the .NET ecosystem expressing how
unsustainable their workload has become.

[**Uno Platform**](https://platform.uno/) has introduced an interesting
initiative to address part of this challenge: **a GitHub sponsorship matching
program for their employees and contributors**.

## **Why This Matters**

Sustainability in open source is not a new conversation. Many of us know the
frustration of seeing small teams or even single individuals carry the weight of
tools used by huge corporations, with little to no support. It‚Äôs a structural
problem, and there‚Äôs no single solution that fixes it.

That‚Äôs why I find this initiative notable. Instead of waiting for a ‚Äúperfect
answer,‚Äù Uno Platform decided to start with something simple and actionable. By
matching the GitHub sponsorships made by their employees or active contributors,
they are essentially doubling the support that goes toward underfunded
maintainers.

It‚Äôs not about fixing everything ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making the ecosystem a little more
balanced.

## **How It Works (Kept Simple)**

The process is intentionally lightweight, more like a startup experiment than a
corporate program:

1. **Sponsor a project or maintainer** on GitHub.

2. **Forward the receipt** (confirmation email or invoice from your GitHub
   billing history) to Uno Platform. info@platform.uno.

3. **Uno Platform matches the sponsorship** and sends its confirmation back.

A few rules are in place to keep things fair:

- Projects must be in the **.NET ecosystem**.

- Dual-licensed/commercial projects are excluded.

- You can‚Äôt sponsor your own project.

The program has a budget cap, but it‚Äôs designed to grow over time depending on
participation.

## **What I Like About This Approach**

There are a few things worth highlighting here:

- **Practicality over perfection.** Uno Platform openly admits this won‚Äôt solve
  the bigger systemic problem. But it _does_ put real money into the hands of
  maintainers who need it.

- **Shared responsibility.** By requiring employees and contributors to sponsor
  first, the program encourages personal investment and then amplifies it.

- **Community-first thinking.** The matching funds aren‚Äôt being funneled back
  into Uno‚Äôs own repos but spread across the .NET open-source ecosystem.

To me, this is a healthy reminder that support for open source doesn‚Äôt have to
be massive to be meaningful. Even small, consistent contributions ‚Äî especially
when doubled ‚Äî can go a long way.

## **The Bigger Picture üåç**

The program may look modest, but it touches on a much larger conversation: **who
should sustain the infrastructure we all depend on?**

Big companies benefit from open source every day, but too often the
responsibility of keeping projects alive falls on individual maintainers.
Initiatives like this one highlight what organizations can do differently: lead
by example, match the efforts of their people, and keep the momentum going for
projects that might otherwise struggle.

## **Final Thoughts**

As someone who follows the evolution of Uno Platform and the broader .NET
ecosystem, I find this move refreshing. It‚Äôs not flashy. It‚Äôs not presented as
the ultimate solution. It‚Äôs simply one more way to acknowledge the imbalance in
open source and to offer concrete help.

If you‚Äôve ever thought about supporting a project or maintainer you rely on,
maybe now‚Äôs a good time to start. Small steps add up ‚Äî and when they‚Äôre matched,
the impact is doubled.
