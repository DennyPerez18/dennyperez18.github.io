Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, community contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to
feature Cheuk Ting Ho, a data scientist, open-source advocate, and PSF Board of
Directors.

Let‚Äôs get to know Cheuk better!

**Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education,
etc.)**

I hold an MPhil in Physics and started my career as a data scientist in the UK.
It was during this time that I was introduced to Python, quickly falling in love
with the language and its welcoming community. Outside of work, I enjoy
exploring creative projects, organizing meetups, and advocating for diversity in
tech.

**How did you first get involved with the Python community?**

My journey started by attending meetups, where I eventually got invited to speak
and later help organize events. My team and I attended PyData London, which led
me to connect with the PyData Amsterdam organizers. From there, I submitted a
proposal and gave my first conference talk‚Äîand things kept snowballing! I became
a board member of the EPS in 2021 and later joined the PSF Board in 2023.

**What personal or professional projects are you currently focused on?**

Right now, I‚Äôm building a project to highlight and celebrate the contributions
of underrepresented open-source contributors. Additionally, I continue to
support Humble Data, a beginner-friendly workshop aimed at bringing more people
into the Python community.

**What PSF activities are you involved in, and which working groups are you
contributing to?**

I currently serve on the Conduct Working Group and the Grants Working Group. I
am always looking for ways to engage more with the community and encourage more
people to participate in shaping the future of the PSF.

**What advice would you give someone considering running for the PSF Board of
Directors?**

Start by getting involved in PSF activities, such as joining a working group and
connecting with those actively engaged in the foundation. Once you understand
the work of the PSF and want to run, seek support from your community‚Äîyour peers
would love to back you! Don't be shy to ask for their encouragement, and also
inspire them to become PSF voting members.

**Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?**

I‚Äôm always happy to connect with folks who are interested in the PSF! Feel free
to reach out via LinkedIn or contact the PSF Board email if you want to get
involved.
