Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series\! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to feature Jannis
Leidel, Software Engineer, longtime open source contributor, and PSF Board
Director.

Letâ€™s get to know Jannis better\!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I'm a software engineer at Anaconda, where I focus on improving Python packaging
and infrastructure, especially conda and conda-forge. Over the past 15+ years,
Iâ€™ve contributed to many core tools in the Python ecosystem, including pip,
virtualenv, PyPI, and conda.

Iâ€™m a member of the conda Steering Council and an active contributor to
open-source sustainability efforts like conda-forge and Jazzband. I serve on the
board of the Python Software Foundation (PSF) and am a PSF Fellow. Iâ€™ve chaired
communications and supported strategic planning and governance efforts,
including the User Success Working Group.

I was deeply involved in the Django project as a core developer, translation
coordinator, and co-founder of the German Django Association, which organized
DjangoCon Europe 2010\.

I studied media art and design at Bauhaus University Weimar, which shapes my
focus on usability, accessibility, and community-centered design in software.
Before Anaconda, I worked at Mozilla, contributing to MDN Web Docs and Firefoxâ€™s
data pipeline.

Outside of work, I support communities like OpenStreetMap, Changing Cities, and
the Open Source Initiative, and enjoy home automation and cycling.

### **How did you first get involved with the Python community?**

I first got involved with the Python community through the Django project in the
mid-2000s. Pythonâ€™s elegance and accessibility drew me in, and Djangoâ€™s
welcoming and collaborative community made it easy to stay.

I started by contributing translations and Django apps, which eventually led to
joining the Django core team. That experience opened the door to contributions
to pip, virtualenv, PyPI, and later to community infrastructure projects like
conda-forge.

Over time, I became more engaged with community governance and sustainability,
which led me to run for the PSF Board. The Python communityâ€™s values of
openness, empathy, and collaboration are a huge part of why Iâ€™ve stayed so
engaged.

---

### **What personal or professional projects are you currently focused on?**

Professionally, Iâ€™m focused on improving Python packaging infrastructure at
Anaconda, particularly within the conda and conda-forge ecosystems.

---

### **What PSF activities are you involved in, and which working groups are you contributing to?**

As a PSF board member, I contribute to:

- Strategic planning and communications

- Supporting fiscal sponsorships and packaging efforts

- The Packaging Working Group

- Fiscal sponsorees Jazzband and PyPA

- Co-founding the User Success Working Group, which aims to improve the Python
  user experience across various domains

- The Finance Committee, helping guide the PSFâ€™s long-term sustainability

---

### **What advice would you give someone considering running for the PSF Board of Directors?**

Iâ€™d tell them to go for it, especially if they care about the community and are
willing to learn.

Serving on the PSF Board isnâ€™t about being the most technical personâ€”itâ€™s about
stewardship, collaboration, and supporting others.

Youâ€™ll need to understand how a U.S. nonprofit operates and how to make
decisions that serve a global community. Itâ€™s meaningful, behind-the-scenes work
that truly makes a difference.

---

### **Is there anything else youâ€™d like to share?**

Just a thank youâ€”for the opportunity to contribute to a community thatâ€™s meant
so much to me over the years. Iâ€™m always happy to connect with others working to
make Python more welcoming, sustainable, and open.
