Welcome to our "People from PSF" interview series! In this series, we introduce
the individuals behind the Python Software Foundation, exploring their unique
journeys, community contributions, and insights. Today, we are excited to
feature Cristi√°n Maureira-Fredes, a PSF Board of Directors and Senior R&D
Manager.

Let‚Äôs get to know Cristi√°n better!

### **Can you tell us a little about yourself? (Your background, hobbies, education, etc.)**

I have a background in Computer Science and later moved briefly into academia to
pursue a doctorate in Astrophysics. Over the years, I‚Äôve developed a passion for
community and conference organizing, automation, video games, web development,
and LEGOs. These interests fuel my work in both the Python community and my
professional career.

### **How did you first get involved with the Python community?**

During my second year at university in 2007, I was working in a computer lab and
became interested in automating processes. I initially used Bash, Perl, and Awk,
but a friend introduced me to Python. After trying it out, I quickly realized
its potential, and that‚Äôs how my journey with Python began.

### **What personal or professional projects are you currently focused on?**

Professionally, I work at The Qt Company, leading two teams, including the one
responsible for PySide, the official Python bindings for the Qt framework, which
is primarily written in C++. As a manager, I interact with people regularly‚Äîan
essential skill that also helps in my community work. In my spare time, I stay
involved with the PSF, EuroPython Society, PyLadies Berlin, PyLadiesCon, PyPI,
Python Chile, and other Python-related initiatives.

### **What PSF activities are you involved in, and which working groups are you contributing to?**

Having recently joined the PSF Board of Directors, I became part of the PyCon US
Working Group, leveraging my conference organizing experience. I have also been
exploring initiatives related to membership and user success, packaging, and
infrastructure, aiming to support the broader Python ecosystem.

### **What advice would you give someone considering running for the PSF Board of Directors?**

There are many ways to contribute to the Python community that don‚Äôt require
being on the board. Many‚Äîincluding myself‚Äîmistakenly believe that real change is
only possible through the board. However, supporting your local community,
volunteering at conferences, and contributing to projects are all valuable ways
to make an impact.

Most board members have extensive experience in local communities and
conferences, and their work has naturally led them to a global role. If you‚Äôve
been actively contributing locally, consider stepping up to serve the wider
Python community‚Äîrunning for the board might be your next step.

### **Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to share?**

I ran for the PSF Board twice before getting elected, so I encourage everyone to
stay persistent and continue improving the Python ecosystem. There are many
projects that need volunteers with diverse skill sets. If you‚Äôre unsure where to
start, join the PSF Office Hours to learn more about ways to contribute!
